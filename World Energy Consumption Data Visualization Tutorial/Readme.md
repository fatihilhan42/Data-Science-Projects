### In this project, we will visualize world energy consumption data and take a closer look at the energy consumption of several major countries.

### About the dataset ------> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption
This dataset is a collection of key metrics maintained by Our World in Data. It is updated regularly and includes data on energy consumption (primary energy, per capita, and growth rates), energy mix, electricity mix and other relevant metrics.

Data sources Energy consumption (primary energy, energy mix and energy intensity): this data is sourced from a combination of two sourcesâ€”the BP Statistical Review of World Energy and SHIFT Data Portal. 
Electricity consumption (electricity consumption, and electricity mix): this data is sourced from a combination of two sourcesâ€”the BP Statistical Review of World Energy and EMBER â€“ Global Electricity Dashboard. Other variables: this data is collected from a variety of sources (United Nations, World Bank, Gapminder, Maddison Project Database, etc.). More information is available in our codebook.
