## K-Means Clustering

### Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

- Use scikit-learn's K-Means Clustering to cluster data

### Introduction

There are many models for **clustering** out there. In this notebook, we will be presenting the model that is considered one of the simplest models amongst them. Despite its simplicity, the **K-means** is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, it is especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from **unlabeled data.** In this notebook, you will learn how to use k-Means for customer segmentation.

Some real-world applications of k-means:

- Customer segmentation
- Understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish
- Pattern recognition
- Machine learning
- Data compression

In this notebook we practice k-means clustering with 2 examples:

- k-means on a random generated dataset
- Using k-means for customer segmentation
