## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a popular and widely used supervised learning algorithm in machine learning. It is a classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., whether an email is spam or not, whether a patient has a disease or not, etc.) based on one or more input features.

### How it Works
The basic idea behind logistic regression is to find a function that maps the input features to the probability of the binary outcome. This function is usually a sigmoid function that outputs values between 0 and 1. If the predicted probability is above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5), the algorithm predicts the positive class (e.g., spam, disease), otherwise it predicts the negative class.

To train a logistic regression model, we need a set of labeled training data that consists of input features and corresponding binary outcome values (0 or 1). The model is then trained using an optimization algorithm that maximizes the likelihood of the observed data given the model parameters.

Once the model is trained, we can use it to predict the probability of the binary outcome for new input data. We can also evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.
