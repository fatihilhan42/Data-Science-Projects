## Libraries used

- pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
- statsmodels: for building ARIMA models

## Loading and preparing the data

- The data is loaded from a CSV file using pandas' read_csv() function.
- The data is then grouped by country using pandas' groupby() function.

## Building the ARIMA model

- An ARIMA model is built for each country using statsmodels' ARIMA() function.
- The order of the ARIMA model is specified as (1,1,1) based on prior analysis and domain knowledge.
- The model is then fitted to the data using the fit() method.

## Generating forecasts

-Forecasts are generated for each country using the forecast() method of the fitted ARIMA model.
- The forecasts are generated for the years 2022 to 2100.
- A new dataframe is created to store the forecasts, which includes the country name, country code, year, and electricity production in TWh.
- Additionally, the dataframe also includes annual change in TWh and solar growth percentage, which are taken as the mean values for each country from the original dataset.

## Saving the forecasts
- The forecasts for all countries are combined into a single dataframe using pandas' concat() function.
- The resulting dataframe is saved to a CSV file using pandas' to_csv() function.

Overall, this ARIMA model provides a way to predict future solar energy production for G20 countries based on historical data. The model can be used for various purposes, such as energy planning, policy-making, and investment decision-making.

The ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a popular time series forecasting method. In this particular dataset, we're using it to forecast the future solar energy production of the G20 countries.

ARIMA models are based on three components: autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA).

Autoregression (AR): This component involves predicting future values based on past values of the variable itself. The order of the autoregression component (represented as p) determines how many past values are used in the prediction.

Differencing (I): This component involves removing the trend from the data to make it stationary. This is necessary because many time series data sets exhibit trends that would otherwise skew the predictions. The order of differencing (represented as d) determines how many times the data must be differenced to achieve stationarity.

Moving Average (MA): This component involves predicting future values based on the average of past errors. The order of the moving average component (represented as q) determines how many past errors are used in the prediction.

In our code, we're using an ARIMA(1,1,1) model. This means that we're using one past value (p=1) to predict future values, we're differencing the data once (d=1) to achieve stationarity, and we're using one past error (q=1) to predict future values.

We fit this ARIMA model to each country's historical solar energy production data, and then generate a forecast for the years 2022 to 2100. Finally, we save the forecast as a CSV file.

Overall, the ARIMA model is a powerful tool for time series forecasting, and can be used in a variety of applications where trends and seasonality are present.
